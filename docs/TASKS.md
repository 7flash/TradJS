# Melina.js Tasks & Ideas

## 🔴 Priority: Fix
- [x] ~~**Concurrent rebuild dedupe should use canonical asset keys**~~ — ✅ DONE. Normalized build dedupe/cache keys to absolute paths so the same file requested via relative and absolute forms now shares one in-flight build/cache entry. Added a focused concurrent style-build regression test.
- [x] ~~**HMR should be opt-in, not default-on**~~ — Completed historically, then removed entirely during `3.0.0` cleanup.
- [x] ~~**Client script build fails with server-only deps**~~ — ✅ DONE. When `page.client.tsx` transitively imports server-only modules (e.g. `sqlite-zod-orm` → `bun:sqlite`), the Bun browser-target build failed. Three layered fixes: (1) `melina-server-stub` plugin stubs server-only packages with Proxy-based exports, (2) `buildClientScript` checks for `null` return from `measure-fn` instead of relying on `try/catch` (measure-fn swallows errors and returns null), (3) `app-router.ts` guards against null/failed builds so pages still render without client interactivity.

## 🟡 Priority: Improve
- [x] ~~**Auto-detect server-only deps**~~ — ✅ DONE. `detectServerOnlyPackages()` scans `node_modules` for packages using `bun:*` imports and auto-stubs them. Also reads `tradjs.serverOnly` from app's `package.json` for explicit additions. Cached after first call. Falls back to known packages (`sqlite-zod-orm`, `telegram`, etc.) if detection fails.
- [x] ~~**Publish v2.4.0**~~ — ✅ DONE. Published `melina@2.4.0` to npm with: tsconfig fix (rootDir→src, clean dist paths), build error reporting, auto-detect server-only deps. All exports paths updated from `dist/src/` to `dist/`.
- [x] ~~**tsconfig dist overlap**~~ — ✅ DONE. Changed `rootDir` from `./` to `./src`, added `include: ["src/**/*"]` and `exclude: ["dist", "node_modules"]`. Removed stale `dist/src/` directory. Declarations now emit to `dist/client/` and `dist/server/` without nesting collision. All 19 lint warnings resolved.

## 🟢 Priority: Features
- [x] ~~**Build error reporting**~~ — ✅ DONE. After `Bun.build()`, now iterates `result.logs` and surfaces errors/warnings to the console with `[Melina Build Error/Warning]` prefix including file:line:column position. If `result.success === false`, throws with concatenated error messages instead of silently failing.
- [x] ~~**Catch-all dynamic routes**~~ — ✅ DONE. Router now supports filesystem segments like `[...slug]`, compiling them to `*slug` patterns that capture the remaining path. Added regex matching + precedence rules so static routes win, normal params come next, and catch-all routes sort last.
- [x] ~~**Hot reload client scripts**~~ — Completed historically, then removed entirely during `3.0.0` cleanup.
- [x] ~~**CSS module / scoped styles**~~ — ✅ DONE. `buildCSSModule()` parses `.module.css` files, extracts class names, generates hash-scoped versions (`.card` → `.card_abc12345`). `melina-css-modules` Bun plugin intercepts `.module.css` imports in client scripts — injects `<style>` tag at runtime, exports class name map. Usage: `import styles from './foo.module.css'; class={styles.card}`. 7 tests. Total: 183 tests, 359 expect() calls.
- [x] ~~**Integration test suite**~~ — ✅ DONE. Already had 165 tests across 9 files (SSR, router, build, reconciler, serve). Added `tests/integration.test.ts` with 11 full-stack tests: spins up a real Melina server, verifies SSR output, HTML structure, client script injection, nested routes, 404s, API routes, request IDs, CSS assets, concurrent requests. Total: 176 tests, 339 expect() calls.

## 🟡 Open Tasks
- [ ] **Optional catch-all segments** — Support `[[...slug]]` semantics for zero-or-more path segments.
- [ ] **Catch-all route examples/docs** — Document `[...slug]` usage in README/docs with nested-route examples.

## 📝 Architecture Notes
- **Package**: `melina` on npm (current published: v2.4.0)
- **Key files**: `src/server/build.ts` (asset pipeline), `src/server/app-router.ts` (routing + script injection)
- **Client build**: `_buildClientScriptImpl` uses Bun's `build()` API with plugins for JSX transform + server stubbing
- **measure-fn integration**: Build uses `createMeasure('build')` — returns `null` on error, does NOT re-throw
- **Linked from**: WARMAPS (`file:../melina.js`), Geeksy (npm registry)
